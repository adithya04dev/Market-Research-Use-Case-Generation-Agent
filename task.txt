Market Research & Use Case Generation Agent
Your goal is to design a Multi-Agent architecture system that generates relevant AI and Generative AI (GenAI) use cases for a given Company or Industry. The system will conduct market research, understand the industry and product, and provide resource assets for AI/ML solutions, focusing on enhancing operations and customer experiences.
The Multi-agent architecture must have the following agents:



Research the Industry or the Company
Use a Web browser tool and understand the industry and segment the company is working in (e.g., Automotive, Manufacturing, Finance, Retail, Healthcare, etc.).
Identify the company’s key offerings and strategic focus areas (e.g., operations, supply chain, customer experience, etc.). A vision and product information on the industry should be fine as well. 


Market Standards & Use Case Generation
Based on the industry conducted, analyze industry trends and standards within the company’s sector related to AI, ML, and automation.
Propose relevant use cases where the company can leverage GenAI, LLMs, and ML technologies to improve their processes, enhance customer satisfaction, and boost operational efficiency.


Resource Asset Collection
Collect the above use cases generated and search for relevant datasets on platforms like Kaggle, HuggingFace, and GitHub.
Save the resource links fetched in a text or markdown file. 
[OPTIONAL: BONUS] If applicable, propose GenAI solutions like document search, automated report generation, and AI-powered chat systems for internal or customer-facing purposes.
Final Proposal
List down the top use cases that can be delivered to the customer, ensuring they are relevant to the company’s goals and operational needs.
Ensure to add references through which certain use cases were suggested
Resource Asset links should be clickable. 




Additional Resources:
You may recommend the agents to refer to reports and insights on AI and digital transformation from industry-specific sources such as McKinsey, Deloitte, or Nexocode.
Search for industry-specific use cases (e.g., “how is the retail industry leveraging AI and ML” or “AI applications in automotive manufacturing”).
Deliverables
Source code: Submit the source code of your Multi-Agentic workflow, along with any necessary scripts, configuration files, and documentation.
Report: Write a report that explains your methodology, results, and conclusions. Include anything that helps illustrate your findings. Architecture flowchart of your implementation is MUST. 
Demo Video: A video showcasing the architecture flowchart and the output generated. Bonus: Deploy the application on Streamlit or Gradio or any other relevant tools. 
Assignment Evaluation Criteria:
Your agent will be evaluated based on the following parameters:
Depth of market research and competitor analysis.
Relevance and creativity of use cases generated for the customer.
Feasibility and practicality of implementing the proposed solutions.
Quality and clarity of the final proposal, including actionable insights.
Suggested Tools & Frameworks
Agent Frameworks: Use OpenAGI, BeyondLLM, LangChain, LLamaIndex, Autogen, or CrewAI for building AI agents. You can check DeepLearning AI short courses for quick tutorials or RAG & Agents Bootcamp. 
Search & Retrieval:
Leverage Tavily or Exa or Serper for advanced web search 
Dataset Sources: Find relevant datasets on Kaggle, HuggingFace, or GitHub etc. 
Feel free to use any other tools you're comfortable with.
