      "For years, sports teams have been using machine learning (ML) to gain an edge by analyzing player statistics and honing pricing, while leagues have been using ML to improve scheduling and other operations processes. Despite these advances, however, sports organizations are often late adopters of emerging technologies overall. As generative AI (GenAI) starts to fundamentally change how business gets done, stakeholders in the sports industry — including teams, leagues, content owners and advertisers — should seize this moment to evaluate how GenAI can help improve the fan experience significantly and help boost revenue.\n",
      "GenAI is highly customizable and can be fine-tuned to recognize new patterns. This can unlock opportunities for teams to create personalized offerings based on fans’ individual preferences and deliver them at scale. Your organization could offer more tailored experiences that deepen fan loyalty and a feeling of connection to a franchise.\n",
      "What could this look like in practice? It’s all about cultivating the ultimate live experience — whether it’s in the stadium or at home watching a game. And it needs to start with getting serious about digitizing fan data.\n",
      "Modernize your fan data collection\n",
      "Collecting data about fan preferences isn’t new. Most organizations already obtain key information about their customers to better under their needs and meet them where they are. Using that valuable data strategically can help you understand fans and craft engagement strategies that build loyalty and better experiences.\n",
      "Game watching experiences are being reinvented through second screens, on-demand statistics, immersive streaming and seamless purchasing options. Now, imagine if you could supercharge an organization’s ability to extract actionable insights from all your unstructured fan data across multiple systems and points of fan engagement. One GenAI model can conduct deep retrieval across your sports business, so you could see incredible ROI — quickly.\n",
      "Deploying an AI model isn’t as challenging as it may sound, especially when fan data is digitized. Moving customer data to cloud enables GenAI to access that data and makes compliance, privacy and governance easier. Businesses can license a private version of one of the publicly available models cloud services providers offer and then customize it to meet their needs. With data in the cloud and a GenAI model at the ready, sports organizations can be set up to process and deliver insights that can power hyper-personalization for fans — at scale.\n",
      "Elevating the fan experience with GenAI-driven experiences\n",
      "In our 2024 AI Business Predictions, we unpack the transformative potential of GenAI to help shape how business gets done. Cloud-based enterprise applications already incorporate GenAI capabilities, but this is just the beginning. Previously complex tasks such as building new processes, creating innovative products and services, and enhancing customer engagement can now be accomplished through “no code” activities facilitated by GenAI. This power extends beyond traditional businesses and has the potential to revolutionize the sports industry, creating exciting new opportunities for revenue generation and immersive fan experiences.\n",
      "Let’s take a look at the possibilities.\n",
      "Imagine Stephen, a loyal fan of his hometown MLB team. Each season, he attends games at the ballpark, whether it’s with his family, business associates or close friends. In the past, Stephen faced a frustrating choice: Spend time selecting games and seats with a team ticketing agent or settle for a rigid package with predetermined games and seats. But thanks to GenAI, new experiences and opportunities emerge for Stephen and for his local team.\n",
      "Past preference data combined with predictive analytics can help generate customized recommendations for Stephen from the point of ticket purchasing to halftime refreshment selections, whether he’s at home or at the stadium.\n",
      "Here are some GenAI-driven fan experiences we expect to see in the near future.\n",
      "Personalized commentary generated by analyzing an individual fan’s viewing history and team/player preferences can enable GenAI to deliver customized content like game highlights. And with some input from Stephen, perhaps he’ll be able to ask for real-time commentary delivered in the style of your favorite comedian or athlete. We already saw this tech piloted during the Paris Olympics with “Your Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock.” NBC’s AI-generated clone of AL Michaels leveraged 5,000 hours of Olympic coverage to deliver personalized daily streaming recaps of the games that could be packages in 7 million different ways.\n",
      "Customized, relevant advertisements and offerings that reach spectators on a personal level — and cut down on game time interruptions. This could be as specific as a notification that pops up while Stephen’s watching the game at home to remind him that this time last week he ordered pizza, and that if he puts in an order now he could have it delivered by halftime. Cross-platform engagement will be more easily enabled. A car ad during a break could be coupled with a personalized reminder that Stephen’s car lease expires soon, and an AI assistant could ask him if he’d like to bookmark his dealership’s page and be reminded to look at his options later.\n",
      "Customized highlights and game summaries based on favorite teams, watching habits and social media activity.\n",
      "High-quality translations of player interviews to grow the sport's and organization's fan base worldwide. This could even include their take on game strategy to deepen understanding and help introduce new fans from other cultures to rules and plays.\n",
      "Engaging branded moments that connect with audiences. For example, replacing the in-stadium ads visible in the background during historic big plays to reflect current sponsors during a high-stakes game moment.\n",
      "The capabilities to bring these experiences to life are already here, or will be soon, and the possibilities are exciting. This unprecedented level of personalization can provide every fan with their own set of options for having fun, while also providing your organization with revenue boosting opportunities.\n",
      "Getting started to change the game\n",
      "The opportunity to build AI-driven sports experiences is very real. And because this is a domain that sees radical improvement and scale with familiarity, teams should start experimenting now to streamline operations and improve the fan experience. To effectively use AI, they should develop a holistic strategy involving the organization’s technology stack, internal skill sets and roadmap. They should utilize the trove of historical data at their disposal to augment their models and expand impact.\n",
      "Building an internal team is key. It should be composed of both technology specialists and your top leaders who know the business, its differentiators and can pinpoint the kinds of data needed to customize GenAI models. Consider a methodology that analyzes the value of existing customer engagement processes, their scalability, how much time is spent on them and the kinds of fan data that can be leveraged to build new fan experiences.\n",
      "As more enterprise applications have GenAI capabilities, it will become easier to improve and scale your fan engagement efforts with an omnichannel approach. Take CRM as one example. AI-powered CRM more easily conducts deep retrieval from past communication histories, purchase data and other intelligence, and delivers insights into how the organization can fine tune existing fan engagement and improve in the future. This may require AI solutions as an overlay in the CRM, depending on the type of data that’s in and out of the CRM instance, and the overall data and AI ecosystem. AI can also help scale competitive landscape analysis. Data-driven insights about competing teams can indicate which sports culture and fan bases have the potential to get the most bang for the buck — and where synergies might indicate joint marketing initiatives that could increase savings and reach.\n",
      "Playing by the rules with responsible AI\n",
      "Yes, embrace the use of AI to improve fan experiences, but implement governance around your AI use to help make responsible and ethical practices as well. Keeping responsible AI guidelines in mind can help you establish a solid foundation for using AI. And to capitalize on the opportunities GenAI presents, sports organizations should prioritize a responsible approach to AI and incorporate trust by design.\n",
      "Be good stewards of your data. Assess its value to your organization while also practicing sound data governance.\n",
      "Leverage your existing governance, cybersecurity, privacy and compliance programs as you establish responsible AI in your organization.\n",
      "Adopt an enterprise-wide approach, with every senior leader understanding their role and responsibilities when it comes to fostering trust in AI systems.\n",
      "Implementing these steps is a good start in establishing AI transparency and accountability. Building trust among fans and stakeholders is key as we work to reimagine the future of sporting events.\n",

Whereas sports analytics were once solely based on human examination, AI now autonomously examines massive troves of performance data. ​​For competitors and their support teams, AI-driven suggestions provide an extra edge when assessing opponents and customizing training. Even for spectators, AI enhances the experience by delivering individually tailored predictions and recommendations.Just as science and engineering have progressively changed the actual contests over the decades through equipment and safety improvements, artificial intelligence in sports now similarly impacts this multi-billion dollar industry from the stands to the fields through connection and insight.This blog explores how artificial intelligence is changing the sports industry, the current uses of Gen AI in sports, and how this technology might continue to evolve in the years ahead. Get comfortable - we have an eventful discussion ahead about AI's growing role within the business of sports.Top Usecase of GenAI in the Sports IndustryBelow, learn about some key use cases of GenAI in sports along with the tools that could help shape the sports industry.1. Player and Team AnalysisGenAI can look at player and team actions to find information that can boost coaching and training. For instance, using computer vision, they can follow and piece apart how athletes move. By doing this, they can see if an athlete is moving wrong or might get hurt. Machine Learning models can check out game videos to find patterns of the other team. Artificial intelligence in sports gives coaches the tools to make smarter game plans and strategies.Specific techniques like pose estimation and motion tracking can identify differences in a player's gait, posture, or technique over time that may relate to fatigue or impaired motor control. GenAI's thorough check on body mechanics can enhance methods for avoiding injury and reaching top-notch performance. The specific findings from GenAI assist in improving players and boosting team output.Here are two tools that could be useful for player and team analysis as described:SportVU: This system uses computer vision and machine learning to track detailed player and ball movements during games. It can analyse factors like speed, distance, accelerations/decelerations, and shot mechanics.KINEXON:This system uses sensors worn by players to provide real-time positional and motion data.2. Injury Prediction and PreventionUsing sensor data and computer vision, GenAI systems can closely monitor athletes during games, practices, and training sessions. Subtle changes and risks can be caught by the algorithms. These could show a higher likelihood of injury. For example, slight changes in running gait detected by skeletal tracking can be an early indicator of leg or foot injuries.GenAI in sports opens up new roads for preventing injuries in sports. The detailed physiological modeling and diagnostics possible with generative algorithms move beyond traditional approaches to sports medicine and athlete health management.Here are two tools that could help with injury prediction and prevention using AI:Sparta ScienceUses motion sensing and computer vision to analyse an athlete's movement patterns. Machine learning models can detect biomechanical deficiencies and elevated injury risk based on the motion data. Provides customised training programs to reduce injury likelihood.Zone 7Uses AI and sports science research to quantify injury risk from workload, fatigue level, and other factors. Models account for age, position, body composition, and medical history. Helps coaches optimise training loads and rest periods to minimise soft tissue injury risk.3. Game Simulation and Strategy PlanningGenerative adversarial networks, a type of GenAI, can simulate hypothetical game scenarios and gameplay footage. Trainers and experts may use these mock scenarios to try various plans and methods against a rival. The simulated outcomes using generative AI in athletics help them select the best plans for dealing with certain rivals or game conditions.For example, football teams can generate simulated plays and matchups to find weaknesses in the opposing defense. In basketball, GenAI can simulate thousands of possessions to determine the highest percentage of shots for a given player against certain defenders. Artificial intelligence can also model the probable impacts of trades, draft selections, or free-agent signings.GenAI game simulation helps in more effective strategizing through artificial trial-and-error at a scale impossible through traditional analytics.Here are two tools that could help with game simulation and strategy planning using AI:Second Spectrum:Uses computer vision and machine learning to create a 'virtual twin' of the real game that runs simulations to predict likely outcomes.DeepGame:Uses deep learning on gameplay data to build AI models of each player4. Sports Commentary and Reporting Natural language processing (NLP) techniques like GPT-3 can auto-generate sports commentary and reporting from live data and match events. The AI commentary can call plays, analyse tactics, and sum up key moments. For post-match reporting, GenAI can also produce recaps, highlights, and data-driven analysis tailored to different audiences. The NLP algorithms can take into account the context and statistics of a game to add colour and drama to the commentary in real time. Generated personalities and tones can cater the coverage to different fan preferences. Automated GenAI reporting expands sports coverage and commentary while maintaining compelling and engaging narratives.Here are two AI tools that could help with sports commentary and reporting:AWS DeepComposer: This uses generative AI to create original music and soundtracks that capture the highlights and excitement of sports games. Arria NLG: This advanced natural language generation platform can auto-generate written content like game recaps and data-driven insights.5.Personalized Fan EngagementTo provide customised fan experiences, GenAI algorithms can model the preferences and behaviours of audiences. Sports teams and broadcasters can use these insights to optimise engagement across media channels. For example, social media platforms can deliver tailored video highlights, personalised promotions, and AI-recommended content to resonate with each fan.Based on their past interactions and activities, the Generative AI identifies what content types, sports stats, and topics each fan finds most appealing. It then generates and delivers bespoke content optimised for that individual. This hyper-personalization enabled by GenAI in sports leads to deeper engagement between sports organisations and their audiences.Here are two AI tools that could help with personalised fan engagement:Narrative Science Quill: Using natural language generation, Quill can create customised sports content for each fan based on their interests. AiBUY: This platform uses AI and analytics to predict what products and promotions each customer will interact with. Sports teams can use it to deliver tailored promotions, special offers, and advertisements to fans6. Immersive Viewing ExperiencesGenAI can process live video to generate augmented reality (AR) overlays and graphics that enhance broadcasts or live streams. For example, shot trajectories, real-time player stats, and situational analysis can be visualised and overlaid onto the gameplay footage. For virtual reality (VR), GenAI can create real-world simulated environments for an immersive in-game perspective. The key innovation is using Generative AI to dynamically generate and adapt AR/VR overlays and environments on the fly, customised to each moment. As the narrative and action of the game shift, the GenAI-powered augmented experiences shift with them, elevating viewing to multidimensional engagement. Here are two AI tools that could enhance immersive viewing experiences for sports:TensorHubUses computer vision and natural language processing to generate AR overlays for broadcasts. Can track gameplay data to overlay real-time stats, analysis, and visualisations tailored to each moment.SynthesiaUses generative AI to create lifelike virtual avatars.

      "3. **Game Simulation and Strategy Planning**\n",
      "   - **Description**: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be used to simulate hypothetical game scenarios and gameplay footage. This allows trainers and coaches to test various strategies and methods against opponents. For example, football teams can generate simulated plays to find weaknesses in the opposing defense, while basketball teams can simulate thousands of possessions to determine the highest percentage shots for a given player. This helps in more effective strategizing and decision-making, providing a competitive edge.\n",
      "   - **Tools**: Second Spectrum, DeepGame\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Sports Commentary and Reporting**\n",
      "   - **Description**: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques like GPT-3 can auto-generate sports commentary and reporting from live data and match events. The AI can call plays, analyze tactics, and summarize key moments, providing real-time commentary that is both accurate and engaging. Post-match reporting can also be generated, offering recaps, highlights, and data-driven analysis tailored to different audiences. This expands sports coverage and commentary, maintaining compelling and engaging narratives.\n",
      "   - **Tools**: AWS DeepComposer, Arria NLG\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Personalized Fan Engagement**\n",
      "   - **Description**: GenAI algorithms can model the preferences and behaviors of audiences, enabling SportsMechanics to provide customized fan experiences. By analyzing past interactions and activities, the system can identify what content types, sports stats, and topics each fan finds most appealing. This allows for the generation and delivery of bespoke content optimized for each individual, leading to deeper engagement and loyalty. For example, social media platforms can deliver tailored video highlights, personalized promotions, and AI-recommended content to resonate with each fan.\n",
